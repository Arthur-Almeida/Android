    <string name="bio">I\'m a software designer, creator of the Pied Piper app and algorithm, and the protagonist in
        HBO\'s Silicon Valley.
        \n\nI invented and built the start-up Pied Piper, a program designed to find music matches, while living
        at Erlich\'s Hacker Hostel alongside his best friend Big Head and fellow geeks Dinesh and Gilfoyle. Pied Piper\'s
        compression algorithm triggered a bidding war and ultimately garnered funding from Peter Gregory\'s company
        Raviga.
        \n\nWe won the TechCrunch Disrupt and $50,000.
